So recently I joined this program to mentor a handful of students in the ropes of Web development. All of them have different levels of expertise some with no programming experience, some with actual web development experience. But I had one goal for all of them, be able to write a web application from the ground up with a database store and frontend jazz. However, I thought bigger and thought it would also be cool to share my lessons on the blog since many people asked me to teach them various parts of development.

This is just an introduction, but it will outline the course. First, I will assume that you know some appropriate levels of programming like if statements and for loops. Of course, if you get confused you are free to ask me questions. Second, I will be teaching this course using PHP and MySQL and I will assume that you have a *NIX like system setup. If you do not have something like this setup, I would recommend in using something like Heroku. It requires absolutely no setup and runs your code. I will introude and teach how to use Heroku in my later lessons. Lastly, I will release a new lesson every Friday, sometimes more often. Oh wait, and we will be using CodeIgniter.

If you last to the end, I will have taught you how to create your very own website, be able to interact with databases with a PHP framework and even write HTML/CSS. If you have any questions, you can email me (if you can find it), but I would prefer that you write a comment below just in case someone else has the same question!

That is it! First lesson will be on Friday, October 12, 2012.

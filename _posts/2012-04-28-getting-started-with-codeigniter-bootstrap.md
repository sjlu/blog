## About

CodeIgniter gives you the ability to write PHP code quickly and effectively while Twitter Bootstrap allows you to create
interfaces quickly without needing to style primary elements. However, the two are not combined and certain things between
CodeIgniter and Twitter Boostrap do not play nicely. With CodeIgniter Bootstrap, it allows you to skip this "combination"
phase and have you start developing your idea instead of developing the common web elements.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have a Apache, MySQL and PHP installation or equilvalent.

When you are done with that, you need to retrieve the CodeIgniter Boostrap code base.

git clone https://github.com/sjlu/CodeIgniter-Bootstrap.git
